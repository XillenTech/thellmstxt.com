      question: "What is a User-Agent?",
      answer:
        "A User-Agent identifies which AI crawler or bot is accessing your website. For example, 'ChatGPT-User' is OpenAI's crawler, while 'Google-Extended' is Google's AI training crawler. Using '*' applies the rule to all AI crawlers.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between Allow and Disallow?",
      answer:
        "Allow tells AI crawlers they can access and learn from specific paths on your website. Disallow blocks them from accessing those paths. Use Allow for content you want AI to understand, and Disallow for private or sensitive areas.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this the same as robots.txt?",
      answer:
        "No, they serve different purposes. robots.txt controls search engine crawlers like Google and Bing, while llms.txt specifically controls AI model training crawlers like ChatGPT and Gemini. You can use both files together.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I generate a file for my Shopify store?",
      answer:
        "You can manually add rules like 'Allow: /products/*' and 'Allow: /collections/*' using the tool above. For a fully automated, one-click solution that syncs with your store and handles all eCommerce-specific paths, visit our premium service at llmstxt.store.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where do I upload the llms.txt file?",
      answer:
        "Upload the file to your website's root directory, so it's accessible at yoursite.com/llms.txt. This is the same location where you'd place robots.txt or sitemap.xml files.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to update my llms.txt file regularly?",
      answer:
        "Only when your website structure changes significantly. If you add new sections, change URL patterns, or want to modify which areas AI can access, you should update your llms.txt file accordingly.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does llms.txt affect my website's SEO?",
      answer:
        "llms.txt doesn't directly affect traditional search engine optimization (SEO) since it's designed for AI crawlers, not search engines. However, it can indirectly benefit your SEO by ensuring AI systems understand your content structure and can recommend your site accurately in AI-powered conversations, potentially driving more qualified traffic.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use llms.txt with any type of website?",
      answer:
        "Yes, llms.txt works with any type of website - from simple blogs to complex e-commerce platforms. The key is identifying which parts of your site should be accessible to AI systems and which should remain private. Most websites benefit from allowing access to public content while blocking admin areas, user accounts, and sensitive information.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I don't have an llms.txt file?",
      answer:
        "Without an llms.txt file, AI crawlers will make their own decisions about which parts of your website to access and learn from. This could result in AI systems accessing areas you'd prefer to keep private, or missing important content that could help with AI-powered recommendations. Having a properly configured llms.txt file gives you control over how AI systems interact with your content.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my llms.txt file is working correctly?",
      answer:
        "You can test your llms.txt file by visiting yourdomain.com/llms.txt in your browser. If the file displays correctly, it's properly uploaded. Additionally, you can monitor your website analytics to see if AI-powered traffic increases after implementing llms.txt. Some AI platforms also provide tools to test how their crawlers interpret your llms.txt file.",
